              Randy is by far our first choice when we need a dog sitter. We have used his service on several occasions, the last one for a period of three weeks.  During that time, he kept the house neat and tidy and stayed in communication with us on a regular basis, eliminating the stress of leaving the dogs and house behind. Above all, Randy is trustworthy, and our dogs love him.  We would be happy to provide personal references upon request.

              We've used Anubis several times and have been very happy with the service and care of our pets. The pet sitter is always great about giving updates while we are gone. Scheduling and payment is super easy We just can't put a price on our pets being so well cared for in our home while we're away - boarding was never a good option for us. We're very satisfied and will continue to work with Anubis.

              I have enjoyed a long and wonderful relationship with Anubis. I live alone and travel constantly. My two dogs are like my children, and I know I’ve got trusted friends to watch over them in my absence. When my beloved dog Miss Elo was sick with a long-term illness, and I had to take a couple of business trips, I asked Anubis to come by my apartment twice a day, to give her medicine and make sure she felt loved. They even called me several times to let me know how Miss Elo was feeling. I couldn’t have gone on those trips, without knowing Miss Elo was in capable and loving hands. To say these folks go the “extra mile” in caring for pets is an under-statement!

              I would like to give my glowing recommendation and praise Anubis. Randy was my pet sitter for two years while I lived in Washington, DC. I completely trusted him with the care of my two fur babies, Daphne and Gateway. Randy was not only honest, reliable, flexible, and available at short notice or emergency situations, he also showed enormous love and compassion for my pets. Often taking the time to sit and love them after a long walk in the park or around the neighborhood. My dogs loved Randy, looking forward to his visits they got excited at the mention of his name.
              <br>
              His rates are very reasonable for the services he renders. In fact as a busy person who felt somewhat guilty leaving her dogs in the care of another, I loved coming home to find Randy's journal entries into my pets day and goings on. I have complete trust in him being in my home and having access to my house key. Randy always did exactly what was asked of him and showed interest and knowledge in my pets, alerting me to potential medical or behavioral problems. My dogs needed the comfort of their own home and became very stressed in any kennel situation. Randy relieved this stress on me and and for them by providing exceptional service at an affordable rate. His never ending love and concern for my dogs will never be forgotten. I moved to Boston from DC which is the only reason Randy is not my pet sitter anymore. I would like to invite anyone with any questions or concerns to please send me an email.
